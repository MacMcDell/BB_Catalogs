# BB_Catalogs
Make sure to run the DBSetup.SQL file first before compiling...otherwise bad things may happend.
You will then have to update your web.config in the BB_CatalogManager and app.config in the mdl project.
This is required. Entity Framework is having a tough time with the circular reference to catalog parentId. 
I have tested it roughly 5 times and it works each time. 
If you compile the app before running the SQL it will autogenerate the tables...somewhere on your machine.
There is an assumption you have .\sqlExpress installed.
